def help():
    """
    Displays a table of available commands for the Address Book and Notes applications.

    The table categorizes commands by functionality, providing a brief description of each command's 
    purpose within the applications. The commands include options for managing contacts in an 
    Address Book and interacting with notes.

    It uses the `rich` library to create a formatted table that is displayed in the console.

    The commands include:
    - Address Book commands for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting contacts
    - Notes commands for managing notes and their associated tags
    - Logs and system commands for viewing logs and handling application control

    Example Usage:
        >>> help()  # Calls the help function to display available commands
